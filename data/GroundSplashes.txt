// Alternative "ground splashes" for mines and such.
// Note that these are different from water splashes because they are bigger
// The format is like this:
// <SplashType> {
// 	<Texture> = <ActorClass>;
// 	<Texture> = <ActorClass>;
// 	<Texture> = <ActorClass>;
// 	...
// }
// Where SplashType is the "splash class" which determines what ground
// splash(es) are spawned, Texture is the floor texture, and ActorClass is
// the ground splash actor to spawn.
// Note 1: SplashType, Texture, and ActorClass are case insensitive.
// Note 2: FileReader.GetString uses . as a data path delimiter, and it cannot
// distinguish between file paths and "data paths", so you should replace any
// dots in the filename with ">" (shift + .)
