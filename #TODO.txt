This is here as a reminder of the issues / to-do we notice from time to time.
Remove the problem / to-do from this list once it is done - OZY81

- Check all graphics / sprites / textures which may use some pngcrush (not much left for sure, Calinou may help us though: https://github.com/Realm667/WolfenDoom/pull/168)
- Check unused graphics and remove them (graphics/hud/creditsroll are not used for example)
- Check unused models and remove them
- Check unused sounds and remove them
- Check unused sprites and remove them
- Get rid of nazibannertall.md2 model and replace it with a .md3 (problem is that it gets skin offsets messed up during conversion atm)
- Get some different sounds for bosses to turn each more distinct (not easy, should check on Wolf3d websites)
- Test all brightmaps, some actors seems to use too many spawned lights which can be removed (specially during attacks)
- Verify actors behavior, mainly props and enemies (don't forget to check LightBulb on maps and optimize lasers)
- Verify every situation on maps where models disappear and use RenderRadius if needed (but watch out about performance!)
